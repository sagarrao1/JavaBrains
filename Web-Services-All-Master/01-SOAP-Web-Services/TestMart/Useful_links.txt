By code also we can publish web service without glassfish deploying it to glassfish server.
using Endpoint class publish method in jdk

crate class TestMartPublisher

run the main program of java class TestMartPublisher
new wsdl url


http://localhost:1234/productcatalog?wsdl


if you use this, it is single thread
if you publish using glass fish server, it is multi threaded
